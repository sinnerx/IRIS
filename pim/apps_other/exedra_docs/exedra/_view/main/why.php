	Why another framework.
	</div>
	<div class='y-content'>
	Simply because I couldn't find any simple framework that could be tailored to my needs. Which is simple and highly modular HMVC Framework. Yes, there're number of hmvc implemented framework out there, but exactly not what i really wanted, because most of them already built with own their convention which limit me to do something I really wanted.<br><br>
	Secondly, i didn't build it only for developer, but a for new maintainer. Which could be anybody from beginner to experts. And, trust me, so little new developer actually like to maintain a projects, that's why people prefer new version.

	No ORM included?
	</div>
	<div class='y-content'>
	I am no fan of ORM. But that's not the reason. I prefer, consistency in database querying, on which the layer of ORM complexities beneath it's simplicity always forced it's user to write inconsistency query everytime they need to break some limit. I don't really care if i need to write longer query. It's more like a war between tabs and space, or psr or non psr, when it comes to preferences.

	Scarce Documentation
	</div>
	<div class='y-content'>
	For me, it's actually not our responsibilities to documents our API, but yours to document and design your projects. <b>But don't worry</b>, because Exedra provide a complete documention, eventhough we said this. This is due to, how little our M.V.C. APIs are. ;)

	What exactly, Exedra main idea is?
	</div>
	<div class='y-content'>
	- Fast (currently clocked at 1.5k - 1.7k request per secs, without APC), <br>
	- Simple (scarce API), <br>
	- Powerful (can do more with little).<br>
	- A platform.
